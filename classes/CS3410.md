title: CS 3410 - Computer System Organization and Programming
layout: article
---

## General Information

CS3410 provides an introduction to computer organization, systems programming and the hardware/software interface. Topics include instruction sets, computer arithmetic, datapath design, data formats, addressing modes, memory hierarchies including caches and virtual memory, I/O devices, bus-based I/O systems, and multicore architectures. Students learn assembly language programming and design a pipelined RISC processor. The course is open to any undergraduate who has mastered the material in [[CS 2110]].

## Prerequisites

Loose prerequisite of [[CS 2110]]

C and UNIX Tools & Scripting would be very nice to have

## Topics Covered

 - Basic Digital Logic
 - Memory
 - CPU with hazards
 - Calling Conventions
 - Linkers
 - Caches
 - Virtual Memory
 - Multicore Architectures
 - Synchronization
 - I/O

## Workload

4 projects with a partner that are fairly time consuming

Minimum: 10 hrs/wk

Average: 15 hrs/wk

Your first two major project involve building a processor in Logisim out of logic gates. After that, you'll be working on a few projects in C. One was Cacheracer, where you write a program that tries to fill up memory as quickly as possible, while competing with another such program via traps and other tools. There are various labs; notably, you exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability in one. The last project in years past was Honeypot, where you and a partner built a program to scan incoming network packets as quickly as possible, competing for the highest MB/s. That has recently been replaced with a project where you implement `malloc`.

## General Advice

Do not take it with [[CS 3110]].

C and UNIX Tools are heavily used in this class. The workload can seem intense because they assume that you will easily pick up a working knowledge of C and unix.

Make use of office hours and Piazza to clarify things, and get a head start on projects!

## Testimonials

It's a lot of work, but you'll come out of it with a better understanding of what is actually going on in your computer. Who knows, you might find assembly and systems programming really fascinating, like I did (after spending years in Python and JavaScript). Also, Professor Bracy has the best analogies.
