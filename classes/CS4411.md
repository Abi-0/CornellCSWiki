## Testimonials

Highly recommend, if only because it makes 4410 make a lot more sense and seem more interesting. I hated 4410 but I liked this prac when I took it the next
semester.

I enjoyed labs 1-3, as well as 6. Lab 4 was a pain, due to all the small details you had to deal with. Lab 5 was just tedious and uninteresting. Lab 6 was huge, but was fun and interesting. I learnt a LOT about C and OS in this class.
