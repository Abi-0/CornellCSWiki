## CS 3410 or CS 3420?

This is difficult to answer, since almost nobody has taken both. Here are some considerations:

- 3410 is a lot of work. Splitting it across 2300 and 3420 might be more manageable.
- 2300 + 3420 will go more in depth than 3410 alone can.
- Many classes (including requirements!) have 3410/3420 as a prerequisite, and you may not want to delay them in order to take 3420.
- Most people take 3410.

## I Have No Idea, But I Took CS 3xxx

Don't know what to do for electives? Here's a few options.

Programming languages: [[ CS 4110 ]]. Also consider [[ CS 4120 ]] for the implementation (compiler) side of things.

Computer graphics: [[ CS 4620 ]]. Also consider [[ CS 3152 ]] for actually making a game.

Artificial intelligence: [[ CS 4700 ]]. Also consider [[ CS 4740 ]] for the language/linguistics side of things.


## I'm Feeling Ambitious

> Note: any CS class is doable given the right combination of hard work, dedication, and experience. While the classes listed here were feasible for those recommending them, professors and curricula change, and your experience may be different.
