title: Graduation Requirements
---

Your exact requirements depend on whether you're enrolled in Arts & Sciences or Engineering. The CS core is the same, thoughâ€”it's the electives that change.

The department has a list of [common requirements](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/undergrad/csmajor).

## Checking Your Status

Once you're affiliated, the department maintains a [CS checklist](https://checklists.cis.cornell.edu/checklist/cs/) for you. This lists your college and major requirements, which classes you have and haven't taken, and which classes you still need. Note that this is only updated about once a semester (since it's all done by hand), so it might be a bit out-of-date. If you're unsure about something, you should talk to your advisor or the CS office (Nicole Roy/Stella Lee).
